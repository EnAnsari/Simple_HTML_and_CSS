            Nancy wants to live a long time.
            She wants to live for one hundred years.
            She is five years old now. She wants to
            live 95 more years. Then she will be 100.
            Her father is 30 years old. He wants to
            live a long time, too. He wants to live
            for one hundred years. He wants to live
            for 70 more years. "Daddy, we will grow
            old together, okay?" Nancy said to her
            father. "Yes, honey, we will grow old
            together," he said to Nancy. Then Nancy
            smiled. She gave her daddy a big hug.

            My Wonderful Family
        </h2>
        <p>
            I live in a house near the mountains.
            I have two brothers and one sister,
            and I was born last. My father teaches
            mathematics, and my mother is a nurse
            at a big hospital. My brothers are
            very smart and work hard in school.
            My sister is a nervous girl, but she
            is very kind. My grandmother also lives
            with us. She came from Italy when I was
            two years old. She has grown old, but
            she is still very strong. She cooks the
            best food!
        </p>
        <p>
            My family is very important to me. We do
            lots of things together. My brothers and
            I like to go on long walks in the mountains.
            My sister likes to cook with my grandmother.
            On the weekends we all play board games
            together. We laugh and always have a good
            time. I love my family very much.
