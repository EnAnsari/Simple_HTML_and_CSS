        hello world,  I am a student.
        what are you doing?

        Hi!

            Nancy wants to live a long time.
            She wants to live for one hundred years.
            She is five years old now. She wants to
            live 95 more years. Then she will be 100.
            Her father is 30 years old. He wants to
            live a long time, too. He wants to live
            for one hundred years. He wants to live
            for 70 more years. "Daddy, we will grow
            old together, okay?" Nancy said to her
            father. "Yes, honey, we will grow old
            together," he said to Nancy. Then Nancy
            smiled. She gave her daddy a big hug.
